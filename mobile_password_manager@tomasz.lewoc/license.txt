   The images under chrome/content/assets/, except
   "show.png", "hide.png", "hdpi.png" and "cbcbcb pixel.png"
   are from the Android Action Bar Icon Pack available at
   http://developer.android.com/design/downloads/index.html
   They came with a notice that says:
   "You may use the materials in this file without restriction
   to develop your apps and to use in your apps."
   Some of them have been modified.

   The images "icon.png" and "chrome/content/hdpi.png"
   were created using this tool:
   http://android-ui-utils.googlecode.com/hg/asset-studio/dist/icons-launcher.html
   and are thus licensed under CC-BY 3.0 Unported
   (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).

   "chrome/content/cbcbcb pixel.png" is ineligible for copyright
   because it is trivial.
